# 🤖 SemuBot

**Estonia's First Humanoid Robot Project**

SemuBot is a student-driven initiative developing Estonia's first humanoid companion robot. Our mission is to create an open-source social robot that can communicate in Estonian and support children with speech therapy and developmental challenges.


## 🎯 Our Mission

We're building a humanoid robot that bridges the gap between human interaction and assistive technology. SemuBot is designed to:

- Support children's speech therapy and communication development at Tartu University Hospital
- Provide companionship and assistance in healthcare, education, and customer service settings
- Advance social robotics research in Estonia and globally
- Serve as an educational platform for students across multiple disciplines
